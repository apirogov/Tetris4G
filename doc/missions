Missions
==============================
Missions are a central aspect of Tetris4G.
They appear randomly from time to time in the "missions" box on the right side
and assign special tasks to the player. The tasks have to be completed in a certain time.
If the players succeeds, his "bias" scale moves in the positive, otherwise in the negative direction.
Additionally, the player can earn "items" for completed missions that make the game easier.

'mission': index of current mission and index for respective image in 'missionimg'

'missionimg': array that includes images for missions:
	'missionimg[0]': image for no mission
	'missionimg[1]': image for mission 1
	...
	'missionimg[n]': image for mission n

'missiongimg[mission]': image that is shown in the mission box

The "bias scale"
==============================
The bias scale shows the chance for bad or good special blocks.
A positive value means only good bonus blocks can spwan, a negative value means only bad bonus blocks.
The higher the value the greater is the chance of the respective blocks.
The value is influenced first by missions (s.o.) and second it decreases constantly over time.

'Bias.val': value of bias (val={-10...0...10}; n\R)
