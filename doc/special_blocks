Special blocks are irregular "mutant" blocks instead of normal
color blocks in a tetromino and they disappear over time
(-> less time to get a good one and no force to get bad ones)
(some bad ones NEED to be taken to prevent an effect...)

===============

Good:
B_JOKER: simple joker block (matches all colors) (permanent)
B_SPECJOKER: special joker block (just for e.g. square 5x5 or row etc) (permanent)

Medium time (3 minutes):
B_STARTMISSION: Start Mission block (enables a quest)
			Quest rewards can be score or long buffs or unlocked spec blocks

Short time (1 minute):
B_REMOVEROW: Row-away block (removes a row from the wall with highest tower)
B_DBLSCORE: Score*2 for 1 minute
B_DBLMVTIME: Movetime*2 for 1 minute

When >50% of field full, chance for:
B_NUKE: Nuke Block (all blocks get one color -> baaam chain reaction)

================
Bad (all 1 minute):
B_HALFMVTIME: Movetime/2 for 1 minute
B_RNDSPAWN:  spawn-block (Spawns 3-7 new random blocks to the world)
B_NEGSCORE: score decreased instead of increased for a formation with that block
